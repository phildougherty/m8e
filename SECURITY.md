## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

#### For Security Vulnerabilities
**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: **security@matey-orchestrator.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7-14 days depending on severity
- **Patch Release**: Critical issues within 24-48 hours
- **Public Disclosure**: 30 days after patch release (coordinated disclosure)

#### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, privilege escalation | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Information disclosure, DoS attacks | 7 days |
| **Medium** | Limited scope vulnerabilities | 14 days |
| **Low** | Minor security issues | 30 days |

### Bug Bounty Program

While we don't currently have a formal bug bounty program, we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve Matey's security:

- **Hall of Fame**: Public recognition for responsible disclosure
- **Swag & Merchandise**: Matey branded items for valid reports
- **Early Access**: Preview access to new features and releases
- **Direct Communication**: Access to development team for collaboration

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
```bash
# Use security contexts
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: matey
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
EOF
```

#### Network Security
```bash
# Apply network policies
kubectl apply -f charts/matey/templates/network-policy.yaml

# Use TLS for all communications
export MATEY_TLS_ENABLED=true
export MATEY_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/certs/tls.crt
export MATEY_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/certs/tls.key
```

#### Secrets Management
```bash
# Use Kubernetes secrets
kubectl create secret generic matey-secrets \
  --from-literal=api-key="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret="$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

# Or use external secret management
helm install external-secrets external-secrets/external-secrets
```

#### Resource Limits
```yaml
# Set resource limits
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Guidelines
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys)
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
5. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms and secure session management

#### Pre-commit Security Checks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run security scans
make security-scan

# Check for secrets
git secrets --scan

# Lint for security issues
golangci-lint run --enable gosec
```

#### Code Review Checklist
